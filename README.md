#Simin Li 15-112 Term Project
This is a drawing game that uses machine learning to classify one out of five strokes made by the user. The goal of the game is to terminate bugs by drawing what appears on the screen as fast as possible. The game accomplishes classification in real time while maintaining high accuracy. Features include Calibration Mode which allows users to input their own training data to personalize the machine learning algorithm to achieve maximum precision; Lightning Bug which gets rid of every bug on the screen when eliminated. The machine learning algorithm makes use of sklearnâ€™s PCA model. Slopes between points evenly chosen on the line created by the user are used as features for classification.
